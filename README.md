# Golang Training Projects

This repository contains various projects and examples created during my Golang training course. Each folder represents a different aspect of Go, including control structures, concurrency with goroutines, an investment calculator, and a REST API with basic CRUD operations.

## Contents

- [Control Structure](./control-structures) - Examples of using control structures in Go.
- [Goroutine](./goroutines-hands-on) - Demonstrations of concurrency using goroutines.
- [Price Calculator](./price-calculator) - A simple calculator for computing investment returns.
- [REST API](./rest-api) - A basic CRUD API built with Go.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, navigate into the respective directory and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within each folder.

### Requirements

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed on your machine.
